## Frontend Test (React)

Your challenge - should you choose to accept it - is to
build a "state-of-the art" encryption tool! ;)

In the Form component, you will find an input and an
output element. A person (let's call him a secret agent)
can enter a message. The message should then be reversed
and the reversed message shown in the output box.

#### Example
##### Input
```
This is a test - is this thing on?
```
##### Output
```
sihT si a tset - si siht gniht ?no
```
